      <p>As a native Vermonter, I have grown up surrounded by the beautiful nature and landscapes that inspire my work in photography. I received my degree in film photography from Keene College in New Hampshire, where I wrote, filmed, edited, and produced short films for local film festivals.</p><br>
      <p>After school, I spent over a year living and traveling throughout Europe. My time abroad opened my eyes to different perspectives and sights, but my passion for photography stayed the same. I came home inspired and ready to challenge myself with new projects.</p><br>
      <p>I currently work on projects for both Vermont Drone and the Regional Educational Television Network. I am involved in every part of the process, from filming to editing.</p>
